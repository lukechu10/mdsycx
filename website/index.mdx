## About {#about}

Plain ol' markdown is a bit boring... What if we could spice it up with
[Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app)?

Meet **mdsycx**!

## Installation

Just run the following command and you are all set to go.

```sh
cargo add mdsycx
```

Alternatively, you can manually add this line to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
mdsycx = "0.2"
```

## Usage

Using mdsycx in your Sycamore app is as easy as pie! Use the `mdsycx::parse` function to parse your
markdown file and use the `mdsycx::MDSycX` component to render it using Sycamore.

```rust
let parsed = parse::<()>(markdown).unwrap();

view! {
    div(class="markdown-container") {
        MDSycX(body=parsed.body)
    }
}
```

## Markdown syntax

Use all your favorite features from markdown. mdsycx uses the excellent
[`pulldown-cmark`](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark) crate as a
[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) spec-compliant parser.

## Using components in your markdown

As advertised, it is possible to use Sycamore components directly in your markdown file.

To do so, you need to make sure the props implement the `FromMd` trait. Luckily, this can be derived
automatically using the derive macro.

```rust
#[derive(Props, FromMd)]
pub struct MyProps {
    /// A prop that can be set from markdown.
    special_number: i32,
    /// The `children` prop is always required.
    children: Children,
}
```

Next, create a component with props of this type. Nothing special is going on here, just your
regular Sycamore component.

```rust
#[component]
fn MyComponent(props: MyProps) -> View {
    let children = props.children.call();
    view! {
        div {
            p { "Your special number is " (props.special_number) "!" }
            p { "Everything else:" }
            (children)
        }
    }
}
```

Last step is to provide this component to the `MDSycX` component. To do so, you need to create a
`ComponentMap`. Basically, this tells mdsycx which component to use when it sees a component in
markdown.

```rust
let components = ComponentMap::new()
    .with("MyComponent", MyComponent)
    .with(/* as many components as you like */);

view! {
    div(class="markdown-container") {
        MDSycX(body=parsed.body, components=components)
    }
}
```

All that's left is to use your fancy new component!

```md
<MyComponent special_number="123">
    Hello from inside!
</MyComponent>
```

In fact, you can even replace built-in HTML elements such as `<a>` with your custom components! How
cool is that?

```rust
let components = ComponentMap::new()
    .with("a", SpecialLink);
```

Note that all props are optional and will be set to their default value if they are missing in
markdown.

## Front matter

Your markdown file can contain a special section called the front matter. This is a place where you
can specify _metadata_ about your markdown file (such as the time it was written, or the author,
etc...). The front matter should be surrounded by "`---`" characters at the top of your file and the
data should be in YAML format.

You might have noticed that the `mdsycx::parse` function is actually generic. The generic parameter
is the type of the front matter of the document. To access the data in the front-matter, you can use
the `.front_matter` field on the struct returned from `mdsycx::parse`.

Yada yada...
```

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Sycamore's Server Side Rendering support should work out of the box! Just make sure you are
rendering the same thing on both the server and the client!

```rust
let string = sycamore::render_to_string(App);
```

## Roadmap

Many features are not yet implemented. Here are a few:

- Built-in syntax highlighting. Right now, we are using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).
- Combining and composing markdown files.
- Easily import your markdown files to Rust.
- And more! If you feel like we left out something important, please feel free to send us a PR!
